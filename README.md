DVRPC uses permanently-installed counters to document use of the regionâ€™s Circuit Trails network as well as on-road bicycle facilities. This interactive map provides a snapshot of this data in a simple, user-friendly format allowing users to explore counts from throughout the region. DVRPC also takes short-duration bicycle and pedestrian counts. Data from these counts is available [https://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/trafficcounts/](here).
